## Usage

### Basic Interaction
- **Mention the bot**: `@Gronk what's the weather?`
- **Reply to Gronk**: Reply to any of Gronk's messages without mentioning (conversation memory)
- **Upload images**: Attach images or paste image URLs for visual analysis
- **Reply chains**: Gronk sees full conversation context in reply threads

### Commands
- **`!search @user [keywords] <query>`**: Search a user's message history
  - Example: `!search @john keyword:python what did he say about testing?`
  - Omit username for channel-wide search
  
**Search Limitations:**
- Maximum of 1,000 messages scanned by default (3,000 with keyword filter)
- Only analyzes up to 100 messages to stay within token limits
- Each message truncated to 300 characters for context
- Bot messages are excluded from channel-wide searches
- Follow-up queries use the same message set from the original search

### Cost Information
- **Grok-4-fast**: $0.20/1M input tokens, $0.50/1M output tokens
- **Grok-2-vision**: $2.00/1M input tokens, $10.00/1M output tokens
- **Web Search**: $25.00 per 1,000 sources (currently limited to 3 sources per search)
- **Cached tokens**: $0.05/1M (75% discount on repeated context)

> **Note:** Pricing and models are subject to change by xAI. Check [x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api) for current pricing. To update models in the bot, edit the model names in `main.py` (search for `grok-4-fast` and `grok-2-vision-1212`).

> **Cost Calculations:** The bot displays estimated costs on each response card based on static pricing values hardcoded in `main.py`. These calculations use the current pricing rates shown above. If xAI changes their pricing, you'll need to manually update the cost calculation formulas in the code to reflect the new rates.

## Architecture

- **Models**: Grok-4-fast (text), Grok-2-vision-1212 (images)
- **Search**: Live Search API with auto mode (3 sources max)
- **Memory**: Per-user, per-channel conversation history (last 10 messages)
- **Image Support**: JPEG, PNG, WebP (attachments, URLs, embeds)
- **Context**: Reply chain traversal + time-aware message history (2-minute window)

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond**: Check that Message Content Intent is enabled in Discord Developer Portal
- **Image errors**: Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats are supported
- **High costs**: Reduce `max_search_results` in `main.py` or set search mode to `"never"`
